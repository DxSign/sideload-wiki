Common reasons for this include signing up with a similar signing provider (e.g., Signulous). Devices can only be unblacklisted by re-registering them and waiting for the blacklist period to lift, which will make their UDID available for full registration again. Unfortunately, we cannot determine if your device is blacklisted until after 3 days of registration. You will receive an email regarding this issue and instructions on how to proceed.</p><h3 id="how-does-instant-delivery-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-instant-delivery-work"><span>How does instant delivery work?</span></a></h3><p>The first 10 devices registered under our accounts are processed instantly, and we filter purchases accordingly.</p><h3 id="how-can-i-pay-via-other-payment-method" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-i-pay-via-other-payment-method"><span>How can I pay via other payment method?</span></a></h3><p>Please create a support ticket in our Discord server, and we will check if we can accept your preferred payment method.

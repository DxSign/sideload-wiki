If you don&#39;t know what chip your device has, refer to appleDB.</p><p>It is crucial to have a processor fast enough to handle intensive emulation like Nintendo Switch, as otherwise you may experience jarring slowdowns.</p><p>As of right now MeloNX has multiple bugs associated with importing Firmware, Keys, and Games.

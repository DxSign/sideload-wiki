<Note>
  You should already have a signing app installed, Please go to our other guides and install one if you haven't already.
</Note>

<Warning>
    It is highly recommended you have a device with an A16 chip or higher. If you don't know what chip your device has, refer to appleDB.
    It is crucial to have a processor fast enough to handle intensive emulation like Nintendo Switch, as otherwise you may experince jarring slowdowns.

    As of right now MeloNX has multiple bugs associated with importing Firmware, Keys, and Games. A solution is shown at the end of this guide.
</Warning>

## Download the MeloNX .ipa

Download the latest release of MeloNX from the releases page on their Git below.&#x20;

```
https://git.743378673.xyz/MeloNX/MeloNX/releases/
```

## Install using Feather

<Warning>
You must have your Debug Certificate imported into Feather! If not, you will be unable to enable JIT.
Please import your JIT certificate if you haven't already, you can download it from https://dxsign.cc/manage
</Warning>

Import that app in the library section by tapping import, and then tapping on the file in your recent files.

After importing it should appear in your library as normal.

Tap on the app, tap sign, and then after it completes signing, tap on it again, and tap install.

After installing you should see MeloNX on your home screen!

BUT WAIT. You still need a method of enabling JIT! For this guide we will be setting up StikJIT.

## Setting up StikJIT

StikJIT is an app that allows you to enable JIT without even needing a seperate server or PC to connect to first.

### To use StikJIT you will need the following:

Access to a Windows PC or Mac (This is only needed for SETUP, and will not be needed after)

On said PC you will need to download Jitterbug Pair, avaliable [here](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/)

StosVPN from the iOS AppStore, which you can find [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051)

StikJIT's .ipa, which you can find [here](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT/releases/)

### Setup 

### For Windows

Extract Jitterbugpair-win64.zip.

Set a passcode for your device if you haven't already. Ensure the device is connected via cable and unlocked.

Open your device to the homescreen.

In File Explorer, locate jitterbugpair.exe and run it by double-clicking or right-clicking and selecting "Open".

JitterbugPair will generate a pairing file in the same folder. This file will have the extension .mobiledevicepairing.

Transfer the pairing file to your iOS device using iCloud Drive, email, or any other method.

### For macOS

Extract Jitterbugpair-macos.zip.

Set a passcode for your device if you haven't already. Ensure the device is connected via cable and unlocked.

Open your device to the homescreen.

Execute JitterBugPair by double-clicking or right-clicking and selecting "Open".

JitterBugPair will generate a pairing file with the extension .mobiledevicepairing.

Transfer the pairing file to your iOS device using iCloud Drive, email, or any other method.

<Warning>
Please do NOT transfer the file using Google Drive! Google Drive does something mysterious to the properties file, that makes it unable to be used! (This goes for gmail as well)

If you update your device, this file will become invalid, and you will need to redo these steps.
</Warning>

### Installing StikJIT

Use Feather along with your DEBUG certificate to install StikJIT the same way you installed MeloNX, if you need the instructions just scroll back up.

### Enabling JIT with StikJIT

Once you've completed all the steps above, all you need to do is the following:

Activate StosVPN by opening the app, and activating it (wow really?)

Open MeloNX in the background

Open StikJIT, and import the pairing file we got from JitterBug Pair earlier (If you sent it to yourself in a Zip, Unzip it in the files app)

Tap Activate JIT, and tap MeloNX.

## Get around the bugs

To get around the current bugs with MeloNX, first you'll need to do the following:

Find your prod.keys and title.keys file, then move them to the "System" folder in the MeloNX folder on your device. The MeloNX folder should be in your On My iPhone/iPad folder.

Download [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eF_OMuHxMBdqf5X5lMVyc24ds9YbOo3D/view?usp=sharing) file from Google Drive.

Extract it, and then in your files app move the extracted folder to the MeloNX folder as well, and tap replace when it asks you to. 

Finally, if you are going to import any games, simply just move them into the ROMs folder within the MeloNX folder instead of importing them through the app. There is no say at the moment when these bugs will be fixed, but when they are, you will be able to import games through the app directly.

### You've now got JIT activated, and can play any Switch games you want once you import the ROMs!

Note: We will NOT give you websites or links to obtain Nintendo Switch rom files. You are on your own in obtaining them.

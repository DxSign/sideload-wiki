description: "Feather is a modern open-source alternative for signing apps, allowing you to add repositories of many .ipa files at once and install with ease."
---

<Note>
  For iOS 17.7+, you need to enable "Online Signing Mode" which we will
  explain in the final section.
</Note>

<Note>
  If your using a dxsign certificate, this process has been made significantly easier by the one click install
  in the dxsign manage page. Go to https://dxsign.cc/manage, tap install, tap Feather, easy as that!
  (you still must enable the online signing mode detailed at the end of the guide)
  
  If you are NOT using a dxsign certificate, you may continue with the tutorial.
</Note>

## Download the Feather .ipa

Download the latest release of feather from the releases page on their GitHub below.&#x20;

```
https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/
```

<Warning>
  Please insure to get the .ipa version and NOT the .tipa version, as that is for TrollStore and will NOT work with this guide.
</Warning>

## Installing Feather

To install Feather on your iOS/iPadOS device you can use KravaSigner, a website that allows you to import your certificate for the purpose of installing .ipa files. Please note dxsign is NOT affiliated with KravaSign in any way.

To start go to this link

```
https://sign.kravasign.com/
```

Then click choose file in the ipa section and select the Feather .ipa you downloaded before.

After that, import your mobile provision and .p12 file you obtained from dxsign.cc, and type in the password given within the file "password" in the folder you downloaded from dxsign. Common passwords are 1234 and abcdefg, but to be sure open your files and tap on the file, where it will then show you your password.

After importing that, click upload and sign.

# Enable Developer Mode

This is required for anything sideloading related.

> **Warning**: Enabling developer mode will (technically) reduce your device's security, as noted in [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device). However, it is required for sideloading apps, so it's a trade-off. 

1. Open the **Settings** app, and scroll down until you see the **Privacy & Security** section.

2. Scroll to the bottom in the **Privacy & Security** section, where you should see the Developer Mode option. When you turn it on, you will be asked to restart your device.
